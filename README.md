![Pastery for Xcode screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/20485/pastery-xcode-screenshot.png)

This Xcode extension allows users to create pastes right from within the Xcode app by using the Xcode extension API.

You have to first open the Pastery.app in order to set the API key and you are ready to go!

The extension allows sending a whole file or just a selection as a paste to Pastery.net

You can set the keyboard shortcut of the extension by visiting Xcode > Preferences > Key Bindings > and filtering for 'Pastery'

This extension was based on the work done by Fernando Bunn for [Xgist](https://github.com/Bunn/Xgist).
